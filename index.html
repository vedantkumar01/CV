        <p>Hello. Nice to meet you. Normally, I don't do that much coding, but in my free time, I like to read, play outside with my friends, and hang out. Since, I made this website, I do coding more often. It is a skill that I feel it is worth learning. I love maths and playing sports as you might find out later on.</p>
